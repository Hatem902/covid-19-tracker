## Covid-19 Real-Time Tracker web-app
Tracks live, relevant, and diverse Covid-19 Data, fetched and then nicely filtered & exposed through graphs, maps, tables and info-boxes.

## Tech

## The different techniques Implemented throughout this build:

• Fetching Data from the Covid-19 API as well as filtering it and exposing it through graphs, maps, tables, and info-boxes.

• Utilizing React Leaflet to show and configure the Map along with its tooltips and indicators.
